Activities of Daily living (ADLs) e.g cooking, working, sleeping and device readings are recorded by smart home inhabitants. The goal is to predict inhabitants activities using device readings. Activity-Assistant is a platform that streamlines the process of data collection. The activitiy-assistant android logger is used to label device readings with current activities.
